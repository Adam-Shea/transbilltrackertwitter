AK SB140,Active,Senate Committee,"This bill has a few ramifications. Firstly, there is no method stated by which to determine “biological sex”. This leaves this determination strategy completely open, meaning methods used could range from forced karyotyping tests, which would be financially prohibitive, to forced genital examinations of children, which leave high potential for childhood sexual abuses. Secondly, this bill is immense and wide reaching, applying to all schools, school districts, or even summer camps who receive public funding or who may play against a public school in athletics. Thirdly, investigations, complaints, or other acts of resistance against this bill have been explicitly forbidden.",Alaska,https://legiscan.com/AK/bill/SB140/2021,12/3/2022,"Gary Stevens, Roger Holland, Shelley Hughes, Peter Micciche, Tom Begich","Shelley Hughes, Lora Reinbold, Mike Shower",,,Sports

Performance by a medical or mental health professional of any act that sterilizes the child including: castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, penectomy, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty;
Performance of a mastectomy; 
Administration or supply of medications that induce temporary or permanent infertility: puberty-blocking medication to stop or delay normal puberty; supraphysiologic doses of testosterone to females; or supraphysiologic doses of estrogen to males
Note: supraphysiologic doses is not a valid concept and it contradicts current science on the subject
Removal of any otherwise healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue
so as to change or affirm a child ’s perception of their sex, if that perception is inconsistent with their biological sex as determined by the child ’s sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles:
Note: Those definitions are inconsistent with current science. Moreover, this will greatly endanger trans children as they will be pushed to seek illegal procedures and treatments. If they do not, it will accentuate their dysphoria and dramatically worsen their mental health.
